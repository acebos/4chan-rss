It’s a disgrace…but now you’ll be able to see for yourselves,” Trump said as he signed the memo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The FBI opened the Crossfire Hurricane investigation in July 2016 over whether members of Trump’s campaign were coordinating with Russian officials. The investigation preceded the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trump and his allies have for years cast doubt on the legitimacy of the FBI’s probe into his campaign, arguing it was a politically motivated investigation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mueller ultimately did not establish that Trump or members of his campaign coordinated or conspired with Moscow to affect the 2016 presidential election, but he and his team declined to reach a conclusion on whether the president obstructed justice.&lt;img alt=&#39;3pnbng.mp4&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1742946067928103.mp4&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1742946067928103.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1742946067928103s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>

    <title>[289] Hegseth Accidentally Adds Journalist To Secret Military Groupchat</title>
    <updated>2025-03-24T19:26:31Z</updated>

    <summary type="html">Jeffrey Goldberg, editor in chief of The Atlantic, was apparently included in a Trump administration group chat on Signal in which top officials debated and then discussed details of attacks against Houthi rebels in Yemen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The initial invite to the group apparently came from national security adviser Mike Waltz. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly sent the group details including weapons used, targets, and timing — two hours ahead of the attacks, which began March 15.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Others in the group were Vice President Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the stunning report, Goldberg claimed Waltz connected with him on Signal on March 11 and, two days later, he was invited to join a chain called the “Houthi PC small group,” in which they discussed strikes against the Houthi militant group in Yemen — seemingly unaware of the journalist’s presence in the group.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He wrote that he initially had strong doubts the text group was real, “because I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Goldberg also said he “could not believe that the national security adviser to the president would be so reckless as to include him in the discussions with senior U.S. officials.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He said he realized the text chain could be real after the person who was supposedly Hegseth messaged to the group that the first detonations in Yemen would be felt in two hours, at 1:45 p.m., which was in line with what took place. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;quote&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5211030-us-houthi-attacks-yemen/&#39;&gt;https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5211030-us-houthi-attacks-yemen/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;WrongNumber.png&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1742844391240502.png&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1742844391240502.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1742844391240502s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>

    <title>[ 33] Fentanyl deaths are plummeting because of biden</title>
    <updated>2025-03-24T20:48:28Z</updated>

    <summary type="html">Fentanyl deaths may be plummeting under trump, but he doesn&amp;#039;t have anything to do with it. NPR proves that it&amp;#039;s because of the most vulnerable users already being dead, and the ones that are left alive are using fentanyl more skillfully and carrying narcan around&lt;br&gt;Trump literally can&amp;#039;t do anything right&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.npr.org/2025/03/24/nx-s1-5328157/fentanyl-overdose-death-drugs&#39;&gt;https://www.npr.org/2025/03/24/nx-s1-5328157/fentanyl-overdose-death-drugs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reporter&amp;#039;s notebook: 8 theories why fentanyl deaths are plummeting&lt;br&gt;Over the past six months, I&amp;#039;ve been tracking something really cool and mysterious happening on American streets. For the first time in 30 years, drug deaths are plunging at a rate that addiction experts say is hopeful — but also baffling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the past, even the most ambitious, well-funded efforts to slow drug deaths only helped a little bit. Reducing fatal overdoses by 8% or 9% was seen as a huge win.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But now, deaths nationwide plunged more than 26% from the peak in June 2023, according to the latest preliminary data gathered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That means roughly 30,000 fewer people a year are dying. Many states are seeing even bigger improvements of 30% to 50%. In some states, progress has been sustained since 2021 and 2022, which suggests this isn&amp;#039;t a temporary blip&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So how did the U.S. finally turn the corner on drug deaths?&lt;br&gt;What&amp;#039;s going on? No one knows for sure, but here are eight leading theories I hear from experts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Naloxone, also known as Narcan, may be the game-changer. The Biden administration raced to make this medication, a nasal spray that quickly reverses opioid and fentanyl overdoses, far more widely available. People can buy it now over the counter without a prescription. It&amp;#039;s distributed for free in many high-risk communities, and people using drugs often carry it. It&amp;#039;s unclear how many lives naloxone is saving each year, but many front-line public health workers tell me the impact is huge.

    <title>[ 70] ‘Incendiary’ devices found at a Tesla showroom in Texas</title>

The APD bomb squad was called out to investigate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The devices were “determined to be incendiary” and were taken by police without incident, APD said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) also responded to the scene, an agency spokesperson told KXAN.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There have been numerous instances of vandalism aimed at Tesla showrooms and cars throughout the nation in the past few weeks, ranging from cars being defaced to cars or even Tesla chargers set on fire. In one instance, the Associated Press reported an Oregon man was arrested after he was accused of throwing Molotov cocktails at a store in Salem. It prompted the Justice Department last week to investigate, with Attorney General Pam Bondi saying “The swarm of violent attacks on Tesla property is nothing short of domestic terrorism.”&lt;img alt=&#39;teslad.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1742857481174598.jpg&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1742857481174598.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1742857481174598s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>

    <link href="https://boards.4channel.org/ck/thread/21260058/" rel="alternate"></link>
    <summary type="html">Hated cooking ever since I was a kid. Been living by myself for many years but literally never made anything that I can say &amp;quot;Wow this is delicious&amp;quot;. Simply have no patience to stand like a little retard over a pan or whatever and flipping or doing whatever the &amp;quot;recipe&amp;quot; demands; can&amp;#039;t stand the measurements - the fact that I can&amp;#039;t do everything precisely pisses me off; also the thing that pisses me off the most is the existence of condiments - I really hate the fact that there&amp;#039;s hundreds of different spices and sauces and shit and I don&amp;#039;t know when they are to be used and which don&amp;#039;t go well with each other etc, it&amp;#039;s mega annoying. I literally don&amp;#039;t even buy or use salt or pepper. Lastly I hate waiting for the water to start boiling, I don&amp;#039;t care I just put it in the pot straight away. The longest food that I can be bothered to cook is to slice some chicken breasts and wait for them to boil in the pot. It&amp;#039;s usually what I eat. For years, I&amp;#039;ve been pretty much only the following things, when it&amp;#039;s not junk-food or take-away: boiled chicken breast; fried/boiled eggs, quickly seared pork/beef steak, quickly fried pork/beef mince. I fry on lard or butter. I have experimented with raw meat eating but I guess the brain-wash and condition runs to deep + years of taste-buds being raped by artificial shit are showing its results: it&amp;#039;s more difficult for me to eat raw meat than cooked (talking purely about the chewing &amp;amp; feeling the taste part); grocery store livers either raw or cooked straight up make me gag even though I enjoy the iron smell. A few days ago I fried 10 eggs on butter and for the first time in a long time they were genuinely unpleasant to eat, no clue why but this has made me despise cooking even more and I&amp;#039;m just going to straight up drink eggs from this point onward, reducing the amount of cooking that I do even more.&lt;img alt=&#39;How-to-boil-chicken-square-new.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/ck/1742892501105277.jpg&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1742892501105277.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/ck/1742892501105277s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>

    <summary type="html">I am getting a new vehicle. I currently have a Honda CR-V, which I like, and so far, my /out/ings have been limited to my home state and sleeping indoors. I want to get into car / truck camping so that I can fish and hike in some remote places. A CR-V is not big enough. The obvious path is to buy a truck, put a topper on, add a mattress, a fridge, and some drawers. Due to the price of trucks, I would have no choice but to buy used. Also, the topper means that the sleeping space is not heated and I have to get in and out to access the two halves of the vehicle. With one of the more truck-like SUVs, I should be able to have the off-roading capability with the single cabin.&lt;br&gt;The other thought that has crossed my mind is a small trailer, which I could get away with on a CR-V. I could tow it in most situations, but there are probably a lot of places that it wouldn&amp;#039;t hold up.&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#039;ve been doing a lot of research, but I&amp;#039;m still lost.

    <summary type="html">Planning on going backpacking and just making it a lifestyle. I&amp;#039;m 30 and have nothing to show for it. I have no future in society, my family hates me but I have to live in their house, can&amp;#039;t find a job, no friends, and I have no interest in living the rest of my life like this. This is no life at all. &lt;br&gt;I want to know everything I need to know and have to start off since this the first time I would do this. &lt;br&gt;I barely have any money but I probably have enough to buy what I need. This is not a vacation though, i&amp;#039;m not going to spend on hotels and restaurants. &lt;br&gt;The idea is to keep moving north and sleeping in a tent.&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#039;m planning to take a bus to get out of the city and then just walk. If I &amp;quot;find&amp;quot; a bike to move faster, i&amp;#039;m taking it. &lt;br&gt;The area i&amp;#039;m going to has a hot climate so no need for winter equipment I would say. &lt;br&gt;If anyone could recommend a book or good yt channel about this it would be appreciated. I still have time to learn all this before I go. &lt;br&gt;I was wondering if to start off it would a good idea to buy a bunch of MRE&amp;#039;s? I really don&amp;#039;t know how I could acquire food without hunting and I don&amp;#039;t have anything to hunt with. &lt;br&gt;Am I naive for thinking I can do this? Is it even possible?&lt;img alt=&#39;Backpacking.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/out/1737743643229823.jpg&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1737743643229823.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/out/1737743643229823s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>

    <summary type="html">Ice types need a serious buff. For starters, Glaceon should get Snow Warning or Chilly Reception. Or both. Ice also needs a new status condition like Frost Bite, which would cut Special Attack and deal chip damage which increases in Snow. Snow shouls also lower the speed of non-Ice types. And it goes without saying that Ice needs more Resistances, for that I think Grass, Dragon and Flying should be Resisted by Ice types. Maybe Bug, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;GF treats Ice likes its this big scary endgame type, you only ever see lategame trainers using it. I think it&amp;#039;s time that Ice types actually reflect this. Buff Ice types.&lt;img alt=&#39;Glaceon.png&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/vp/1742945860754751.png&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1742945860754751.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/vp/1742945860754751s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>
