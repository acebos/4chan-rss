The Commission said the EU welcomed the agreement between Washington and Kyiv.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The end of the Russian unprovoked and unjustified aggression in Ukraine and unconditional withdrawal of all Russian military forces from the entire territory of Ukraine would be one of the main preconditions to amend or lift sanctions,&amp;quot; EU spokeswoman for foreign affairs and security policy, Anitta Hipper, said in a statement.&lt;img alt=&#39;East-Hem_1000bc.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1743075020347974.jpg&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1743075020347974.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1743075020347974s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>

It says that Vice-President JD Vance, who became a member of the Smithsonian Board of Regents due to his position in government, will lead the purge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trump&amp;#039;s order says that Congress should not fund Smithsonian exhibits and programmes that &amp;quot;divide Americans by race&amp;quot;. It alleges that the American Women&amp;#039;s History Museum, which is in development, plans to &amp;quot;recognize men as women&amp;quot;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It also singles out the National Museum of African American History and Culture, saying that the museum &amp;quot;has proclaimed that &amp;#039;hard work,&amp;#039; &amp;#039;individualism,&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;the nuclear family&amp;#039; are aspects of &amp;#039;White culture&amp;#039;.&amp;quot; The museum opened in 2016 in Washington as former President Barack Obama, America&amp;#039;s first black president, was leaving office. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Smithsonian museums offer free entry to some 15 to 30 million visitors each year. It operates 21 museums in Washington, Virgina and New York. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They include the National Museum of American History, the National Portrait Gallery, the American Art Museum, the National Zoo and more than a dozen others.&lt;img alt=&#39;1734199892138669.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1743173416090427.jpg&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1743173416090427.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1743173416090427s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>

    <title>[ 34] Man arrested in Molotov cocktail attack at Tesla shop in Las Vegas will also face federal charges</title>
    <updated>2025-03-27T21:51:38Z</updated>

    <summary type="html">A Las Vegas man has been charged in the Molotov cocktail attack that torched several Teslas at a dealership last week. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paul Hyon Kim, 36, was arrested Wednesday by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, after at least five cars were allegedly set on fire on March 18 at a local Tesla Collision Center.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kim has been charged with multiple crimes ranging from destruction of property, arson and possessing a fire device, according to jail records. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He will also face federal charges, Spencer Evans, the FBI agent-in-charge of the bureau&amp;#039;s Las Vegas office, told reporters at a Thursday news briefing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;There&amp;#039;s nothing courageous or noble about firebombing private property and terrorizing your local community,&amp;quot; Evans said. &amp;quot;The self-righteous mob that&amp;#039;s cheering you on today to commit acts of violence on their behalf will leave you high and dry and forget about you tomorrow. And at the end of the day, you and you alone will be held responsible and face the prospect of a lengthy prison sentence.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;Police say Kim arrived near the location in a black Hyundai Elantra before walking over to the Tesla building. He allegedly concealed his face, wore gloves and black clothing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He allegedly also damaged surveillance cameras with a rifle, police said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The word &amp;quot;resist&amp;quot; was spray-painted on the Tesla center’s front doors. An unlit Molotov cocktail was found in one of the cars, police said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Authorities said Kim&amp;#039;s social media activity showed potential links to communist groups and Palestinian causes. His DNA matched DNA samples collected at the scene of the attack, authorities said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.foxnews.com/us/man-arrested-molotov-cocktail-attack-tesla-shop-las-vegas-federal-charges&#39;&gt;https://www.foxnews.com/us/man-arrested-molotov-cocktail-attack-tesla-shop-las-vegas-federal-charges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;a34t.png&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1743112298381741.png&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1743112298381741.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1743112298381741s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>

The alleged 24-year-old gang member, who was arrested in Prince William County, has not yet been publicly named and is expected to face charges in the Eastern District of Virginia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Attorney General Pam Bondi, who was present for the raid along with FBI Director Kash Patel, said in a news conference that the man was “the leader for the East Coast, one of the top three in the entire country, right here in Virginia, living half an hour outside of Washington, DC.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“He is an illegal alien from El Salvador, and he will not be living in our country much longer,” Bondi said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The arrest was executed by a new interagency task force established by the Trump administration to target transnational organized crime and coordinate ongoing immigration enforcement efforts across Virginia. Its creation was part of a crackdown by the Trump administration on foreign gang members residing in the United States.&lt;img alt=&#39;fyr4ss.mp4&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1743100093185434.mp4&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1743100093185434.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1743100093185434s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>

    <title>[128] Trump team revokes $11 billion in funding for addiction, mental health care</title>

He warned the move could trigger layoffs and treatment disruptions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Services will be dropped in the middle. Bang, the clinic is closing. It&amp;#039;s a brutal way to make these cuts,&amp;quot; Humphreys said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The federal grant funding had been scheduled to run through September 2025. In a statement sent to NPR, a spokesperson with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said it made sense to freeze the program immediately.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The COVID-19 pandemic is over, and HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago,&amp;quot; the statement said, adding that the Trump administration will refocus funding on America&amp;#039;s &amp;quot;chronic disease epidemic.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drug overdoses linked to fentanyl and other substances have declined sharply in recent years, thanks in part to a surge in funding for addiction treatment during the Biden administration. But street drugs still kill more than 84,000 people in the U.S. every year, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Donald Trump has made fentanyl smuggling a top concern during the opening weeks of his administration, extending an emergency declaration linked to the powerful street opioid.&lt;img alt=&#39;Trump Beast.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1743106703533008.jpg&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1743106703533008.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1743106703533008s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>

    <summary type="html">And we are back! Very sorry again for the delay, life is busy and I am trying my best to keep these threads rolling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last time... on Twokinds!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Raine&amp;#039;s secret explored! It was revealed that the young magic user was the daughter of Euchre and the former Grand Templar, Mary Silverlock, and that she inherited her transformation abilities from her father!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just as Raine&amp;#039;s ability was revealed, Team B fell under attack by Natani&amp;#039;s brother, Zen! Who used poison arrows to incapacitate Karen and Maren! However, Zen was eventually captured through a clever scheme devised by both Red and Sythe!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, Keith&amp;#039;s desire to remain with his deceased fiance brought him dangerously close to the edge! But thanks to the efforts of Natani and Trace, Keith was forced to realize that Laura was indeed just an illusion, and was able to let go of the love his life, for the final time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After some time, Zen regained consciousness, and was able to establish communication with Nantani, and the two were able to transfer information between both Teams. Team B was ultimately untrusting of Zen, and opted to use Raine&amp;#039;s magic inhibitor to guarantee against any magic usage from the wolf assassin! However, the inhibitor cut off the siblings&amp;#039; mindlink, causing Natani&amp;#039;s mind to return to a fractured state! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And now... Team A continues to sail towards Edinmire, the location of Trace&amp;#039;s former estate!&lt;img alt=&#39;openingcrawl.png&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/co/1743209400121496.png&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1743209400121496.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/co/1743209400121496s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>
