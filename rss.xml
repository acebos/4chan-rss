The Commission said the EU welcomed the agreement between Washington and Kyiv.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The end of the Russian unprovoked and unjustified aggression in Ukraine and unconditional withdrawal of all Russian military forces from the entire territory of Ukraine would be one of the main preconditions to amend or lift sanctions,&amp;quot; EU spokeswoman for foreign affairs and security policy, Anitta Hipper, said in a statement.&lt;img alt=&#39;East-Hem_1000bc.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1743075020347974.jpg&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1743075020347974.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1743075020347974s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>

The alleged 24-year-old gang member, who was arrested in Prince William County, has not yet been publicly named and is expected to face charges in the Eastern District of Virginia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Attorney General Pam Bondi, who was present for the raid along with FBI Director Kash Patel, said in a news conference that the man was “the leader for the East Coast, one of the top three in the entire country, right here in Virginia, living half an hour outside of Washington, DC.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“He is an illegal alien from El Salvador, and he will not be living in our country much longer,” Bondi said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The arrest was executed by a new interagency task force established by the Trump administration to target transnational organized crime and coordinate ongoing immigration enforcement efforts across Virginia. Its creation was part of a crackdown by the Trump administration on foreign gang members residing in the United States.&lt;img alt=&#39;fyr4ss.mp4&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1743100093185434.mp4&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1743100093185434.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1743100093185434s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>

    <title>[ 87] Trump team revokes $11 billion in funding for addiction, mental health care</title>

    <summary type="html">&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.npr.org/2025/03/27/nx-s1-5342368/addiction-trump-mental-health-funding&#39;&gt;https://www.npr.org/2025/03/27/nx-s1-5342368/addiction-trump-mental-health-funding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;State and county public health departments and non-profit groups are reeling after the Trump administration announced abrupt cancelation and revocation of roughly $11.4 billion in COVID-era funding for grants linked to addiction, mental health and other programs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This is is chopping things off in the middle while people are actually doing the work,&amp;quot; said Keith Humphreys, an addiction policy researcher at Stanford University, who also volunteers doing harm reduction work with people in addiction. He warned the move could trigger layoffs and treatment disruptions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Services will be dropped in the middle. Bang, the clinic is closing. It&amp;#039;s a brutal way to make these cuts,&amp;quot; Humphreys said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The federal grant funding had been scheduled to run through September 2025. In a statement sent to NPR, a spokesperson with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said it made sense to freeze the program immediately.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The COVID-19 pandemic is over, and HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago,&amp;quot; the statement said, adding that the Trump administration will refocus funding on America&amp;#039;s &amp;quot;chronic disease epidemic.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drug overdoses linked to fentanyl and other substances have declined sharply in recent years, thanks in part to a surge in funding for addiction treatment during the Biden administration. But street drugs still kill more than 84,000 people in the U.S. every year, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Donald Trump has made fentanyl smuggling a top concern during the opening weeks of his administration, extending an emergency declaration linked to the powerful street opioid.&lt;img alt=&#39;Trump Beast.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1743106703533008.jpg&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1743106703533008.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1743106703533008s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>

    <title>[ 97] Trump declassifies the FBI investigation of himself in 2016</title>

It’s a disgrace…but now you’ll be able to see for yourselves,” Trump said as he signed the memo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The FBI opened the Crossfire Hurricane investigation in July 2016 over whether members of Trump’s campaign were coordinating with Russian officials. The investigation preceded the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trump and his allies have for years cast doubt on the legitimacy of the FBI’s probe into his campaign, arguing it was a politically motivated investigation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mueller ultimately did not establish that Trump or members of his campaign coordinated or conspired with Moscow to affect the 2016 presidential election, but he and his team declined to reach a conclusion on whether the president obstructed justice.&lt;img alt=&#39;3pnbng.mp4&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1742946067928103.mp4&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1742946067928103.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1742946067928103s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>

Give us the consequences there. And what are you learning once they’re arrested? Why are they doing this?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BONDI: Well, we’re looking at so much on this. There have been three federal charges so far. And I say so far. We are looking at all of these cases across the country. We have a dedicated task force.&lt;br&gt;These are not isolated incidents, as you know, and these aren’t vandals. These are Molotov cocktails. That could be a weapon of mass destruction…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BARTIROMO: Wow.&lt;img alt=&#39;1733571901449496.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1742952920782148.jpg&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1742952920782148.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1742952920782148s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>

    <title>[421] Hegseth Accidentally Adds Journalist To Secret Military Groupchat</title>

    <summary type="html">Jeffrey Goldberg, editor in chief of The Atlantic, was apparently included in a Trump administration group chat on Signal in which top officials debated and then discussed details of attacks against Houthi rebels in Yemen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The initial invite to the group apparently came from national security adviser Mike Waltz. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly sent the group details including weapons used, targets, and timing — two hours ahead of the attacks, which began March 15.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Others in the group were Vice President Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the stunning report, Goldberg claimed Waltz connected with him on Signal on March 11 and, two days later, he was invited to join a chain called the “Houthi PC small group,” in which they discussed strikes against the Houthi militant group in Yemen — seemingly unaware of the journalist’s presence in the group.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He wrote that he initially had strong doubts the text group was real, “because I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Goldberg also said he “could not believe that the national security adviser to the president would be so reckless as to include him in the discussions with senior U.S. officials.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He said he realized the text chain could be real after the person who was supposedly Hegseth messaged to the group that the first detonations in Yemen would be felt in two hours, at 1:45 p.m., which was in line with what took place. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;quote&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5211030-us-houthi-attacks-yemen/&#39;&gt;https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5211030-us-houthi-attacks-yemen/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;WrongNumber.png&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1742844391240502.png&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1742844391240502.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1742844391240502s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>

    <title>[ 89] Company Creates World’s First Self-Cooling Beverage Can</title>
    <updated>2025-03-26T00:48:35Z</updated>
    <id>tag:boards.4channel.org,2025-03-26:/ck/thread/21261694/</id>

    <summary type="html">A London-based startup has come up with an innovative self-cooling beverage can technology that could soon make drink refrigerators obsolete.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are few things better than a cold drink on a hot summer day, but with energy costs and refrigeration-related carbon emissions increasing every year, it’s high time humanity came up with a better, more eco-friendly way of chilling beverages. Enter Delta H Innovations, a London-based startup that claims to have developed the world’s first self-cooling aluminum can. Codenamed ‘Cool Can’, this intriguing invention combines clever design with simple chemistry to make magic happen at the press of a button. The company claims that the Cool Can can lower the temperature of its liquid contents to about 6-7 degrees Celsius (42.8 – 44.6 Fahrenheit) and keep them cool for up to 45 minutes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Cool Can looks like a normal aluminum beverage can, apart from the large “power” button on the bottom. The base of the can acts as a hidden water container, and when the button is pressed, the water is released into the space between the can’s double aluminum walls. Embedded between the walls are proprietary salts, which, in reaction with the water, start to rapidly cool the beverage inside.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to James Vyse, the Welsh founder of Delta H Innovations, it can take up to 10 minutes for the beverage to reach 6-7 degrees Celsius, depending on local temperature, but thanks to the can’s double-layer design, the contents remain cool for about 45 minutes. To let users know that their drink has cooled down enough, the Cool Can features a clever snowflake mark that turns from white to blue when the temperature of the can drops low enough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.odditycentral.com/news/finally-company-creates-worlds-first-self-cooling-beverage-can.html&#39;&gt;https://www.odditycentral.com/news/finally-company-creates-worlds-first-self-cooling-beverage-can.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;cool-can-1536x1536.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/ck/1742950115182285.jpg&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1742950115182285.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/ck/1742950115182285s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>

    <title>[132] /out/ings with a pipe</title>
    <updated>2024-12-29T20:31:14Z</updated>

    <link href="https://boards.4channel.org/out/thread/2797205/" rel="alternate"></link>
    <summary type="html">Old thread: &lt;span class=&#34;deadlink&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;2774508&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a thread for enjoying a pipe while doing outdoor activities. If you ask why this belongs on /out/, you&amp;#039;ve never spent an evening by the campfire with a pipe silently enjoying the nature around you, and you&amp;#039;re missing out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;quote&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;how to get started&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Purchase a Missouri Meerschaum Legend and a pouch of Half and Half or Captain Black tobacco, available at most smoke shops. You will need a lighter or match, and something to tamp it with--a large nail works well if you don&amp;#039;t have a pipe tool. Fill the pipe with tobacco, pack it down halfway, top it off, pack it down to 3/4, top it off again, pack gently and enjoy. Smoke slower than you think you need to, the tobacco tastes best when it is burning cool. Tamp and re-light as needed. If you still have trouble, try different methods on YouTube until you find one that works for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;quote&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;smoking a pipe will give you cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;While any tobacco consumption comes with some risk, the cancer risks from occasional pipe use are pretty minimal. Educate yourself and make your own informed health decisions. Some info here &lt;a href=&#39;https://aacrjournals.org/cancerpreventionresearch/article/10/12/704/46541/Association-between-Cigar-or-Pipe-Smoking-and&#39;&gt;https://aacrjournals.org/cancerpreventionresearch/article/10/12/704/46541/Association-between-Cigar-or-Pipe-Smoking-and&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;quote&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;muh weed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not the time or place. Start your own thread&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;quote&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;I DON’T LIKE WHAT YOU LIKE REEEEEE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then leave the thread. Pipes have been a part of outdoors culture for centuries. If you don’t like it, leave.&lt;img alt=&#39;0687fd190525af3678814c5f459c2d0a.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/out/1735504274605513.jpg&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1735504274605513.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/out/1735504274605513s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>

The Roosters’ thrilling 38-32 win over Penrith in round 2 was quickly overshadowed by a disappointing 14-6 loss to the Warriors last weekend, highlighting their inconsistency. Meanwhile, the Titans responded to a 40-point thrashing by the Bulldogs with a strong defensive display, shutting down Newcastle 26-6. The Roosters have dominated recent encounters, winning eleven straight against the Titans. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roosters 1-12 2.95&lt;br&gt;Roosters 13+ 2.50&lt;br&gt;Titans 1-12 3.80&lt;br&gt;Titans 13+ 7.00&lt;br&gt;Line Roosters -6.5 1.91 Titans +6.5 1.89&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;quote&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;GAME 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Redcliffe Dolphins v Brisbane Broncos &lt;br&gt;8:00pm AEDST on Fox, Kayo and Ch9&lt;br&gt;Suncorp Stadium, Brisbane &lt;br&gt;4.45-1.21&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;quote&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;The fifth Battle For Brisbane could be the spark to the Dolphins 2025 campaign as the Broncos aim to claim back-to-back Queensland derby wins when they face the Dolphins at Suncorp Stadium on Friday night. The Dolphins have endured a frustrating start to 2025, sitting at 0-3. Last week’s 30-18 collapse against the Tigers underscored their inability to close out games, an issue they must address against a polished Broncos side. Fresh off a 26-16 victory over the Cowboys, Brisbane will be eager to build on their momentum. The Broncos showed resilience in their win over North Queensland, controlling key moments despite defensive lapses. The Broncos have won three of the last four head-to-head clashes, but the Dolphins claimed the most recent bragging rights with a dominant 40-6 victory in round 26 last year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dolphins 1-12 5.40&lt;br&gt;Dolphins 13+ 12.50&lt;br&gt;Broncos 1-12 3.10&lt;br&gt;Broncos 13+ 1.81&lt;br&gt;Line Dolphins +12.5 1.90 Broncos -12.5 1.90&lt;img alt=&#39;Good news.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/sp/1743111096654420.jpg&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1743111096654420.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/sp/1743111096654420s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>

    <title>[ 95] I don&#39;t understand these types of artists whose mental health is affected by AI</title>

    <summary type="html">I don&amp;#039;t understand these types of artists whose mental health is affected by AI-generated garbage. Tell me again how this affects an artist in any way.&lt;br&gt;Art is all about self-expression, something AI cannot achieve because it lacks agency, humanity, a soul, or whatever else you want to call it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think the artists who are having a meltdown are the ones who have never dared to put something of themselves in their art, only chasing after current trends and attention from an audience.&lt;br&gt;I guess if your art has nothing to say and can only exist because of its visuals, I can understand the fear of AI &amp;quot;taking your job&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;But is that the fault of AI, or rather the unwillingness of the artist not to do more with their art, infusing it with life which goes beyond the visual?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Artists who are telling a story through art stay unbothered by AI. Don&amp;#039;t you think there is a reason for that?&lt;br&gt;They are too busy drawing and expressing themselves to care about some robots imitating what it&amp;#039;s like to be human.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once again, the age-old saying holds true: JUST DRAW!&lt;img alt=&#39;Gm8d8AObYAImwUr.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/co/1743145685049152.jpg&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1743145685049152.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/co/1743145685049152s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>
