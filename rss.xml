During that time, the American Friends Service Committee, with the help of volunteers, helped with emergency supplies, clothes, food and basic necessities during the time the asylum seekers were waiting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of their tents remains, but they haven’t seen a migrant since mid-February.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We haven’t seen people in a while,” Adriana Jasso, the committee’s program coordinator said&lt;img alt=&#39;1741771437862429 (1).webm&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1743600566170191.webm&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1743600566170191.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1743600566170191s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>

    <title>[ 33] Loser Musk loses again, costs GOP Wisconsin Supreme Court</title>
    <updated>2025-04-02T04:31:13Z</updated>

    <summary type="html">&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/wisconsin-supreme-court-election-results-rcna198353&#39;&gt;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/wisconsin-supreme-court-election-results-rcna198353&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Susan Crawford has won a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, NBC News projects, allowing liberals to maintain their narrow majority on the battleground state’s highest court — and defying Elon Musk after he spent millions of dollars to oppose her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crawford, a Dane County circuit judge who was backed by Democrats, secured a 10-year term on the court over Brad Schimel, a Waukesha County circuit judge and a former Republican attorney general. As the first major battleground state election of President Donald Trump’s second term, the technically nonpartisan contest drew national attention and became the most expensive state Supreme Court race in U.S. history. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The outcome is a setback for Trump and his billionaire adviser, Musk. Trump endorsed Schimel in the final stretch of the race, while Musk injected himself into the center of it, spending huge sums of money, visiting Wisconsin days out from Election Day and frequently posting about the race on his X feed. In turn, Democrats and progressive groups made Musk their primary villain, attacking his influence on the race and his efforts to slash federal jobs and the government through the Department of Government Efficiency. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;As a little girl growing up in Chippewa Falls, I never could have imagined that I’d be taking on the richest man in the world for justice in Wisconsin,&amp;quot; Crawford told supporters Tuesday night. &amp;quot;And we won.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a brief concession speech, Schimel said, &amp;quot;I knew I had to put my all in,&amp;quot; but that &amp;quot;you gotta accept the results.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crawford’s victory also means liberals will maintain a 4-3 advantage on the court for at least another year heading into a term when it could decide cases about abortion rights, unions and collective bargaining rights, and congressional maps and redistricting.&lt;img alt=&#39;1741535582203.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1743568273912478.jpg&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1743568273912478.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1743568273912478s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>

I will say this a lot of the people working with DOGE are the secretaries, the heads of the various agencies, and they&amp;#039;ve learned a lot. And they&amp;#039;re dealing with the DOGE people.

Marjorie Taylor Greene.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Coupled with President Donald Trump’s declaration on Tuesday that he would “love to” see federal funding cut off, the nation’s public broadcasting system is facing perhaps the biggest threat to its existence since it was first established in 1967. The broadcasters get roughly half a billion dollars in public money through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Republicans have frequently grumbled that PBS and NPR news programming leans left, but efforts to cut or eliminate funding usually fade because legislators want to protect their local stations — 336 of them for PBS alone, with those in rural areas most heavily dependent on taxpayer money.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The hearings on behalf of the new administration are one of multiple front on which Trump and his allies are aggressively challenging and in some cases sanctioning the American media, which the president has been sharply critical of for years. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This week alone, he denounced The Atlantic repeatedly for publishing texts from the Signal messaging app among high-ranking defense officials planning a military attack. Trump has also taken action against the Voice of America and other government-funded media and barred The Associated Press from the White House press pool and other events.&lt;img alt=&#39;1737530713043203.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1743462529935158.jpg&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1743462529935158.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1743462529935158s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>

    <summary type="html">I am in a position now where money is no issue. With this in mind, I have been looking into the best possible material for cookware, and am trying to assemble a &amp;quot;tier list&amp;quot;, with the caveat that it&amp;#039;s not really a tier list because some materials excel in one field and others in others. What would be the absolute best possible pan you could get, and where would you get it? I&amp;#039;ve come to the conclusion that a silver clad gold pan would be best for quality, whereas titanium clad copper would be the best for durability. Is this accurate?

    <summary type="html">This is a general thread for people to post their AI art, and make requests from others who may want to attempt making their own Pokemon related gens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NovelAI is a paid AI generator. Opus tier users have &amp;quot;unlimited&amp;quot; Small/Normal generations, though editing tools require credits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Microsoft&amp;#039;s Bing AI is a free image generator that is powered by DALL·E 3.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Civitai is free using its ‘buzz’ currency. You get about 50 every day plus more for liking models and gens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;quote&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;civitai.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Otaiku is a (mostly) free mobile app. An ad watch is required between each image generation unless you pay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;quote&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;ailla.biz/otaiku&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tensor is free to use as well, although you are limited to how many gens you can make per day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;quote&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://tensor.art/&#39;&gt;https://tensor.art/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Local Generation using Stable Diffusion requires a decent video card. Guides for local genning can be found in the /g/ threads:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;//boards.4chan.org/g/catalog#s=sdg&#34; class=&#34;quotelink&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;/g/sdg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;//boards.4chan.org/g/catalog#s=ldg&#34; class=&#34;quotelink&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;/g/ldg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other Stable Diffusion threads are on: /h/, /e/, /d/, /b/, /vt/, /aco/, /trash/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hailuo AI takes uploaded art and animates them based on the prompts you get. You get a 3-day free trial, followed by roughly 3 free gens a day afterward. Subscription plans are available.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;quote&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://hailuoai.video/&#39;&gt;https://hailuoai.video/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pastebin of Pokemon artists:&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;quote&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://pastebin.com/U0mmK3Tm&#39;&gt;https://pastebin.com/U0mmK3Tm&lt;/a&gt; (embed)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Characters with under 300 images will require more tags to have them look correct. This is a list of all Pokemon characters with over 300 images:&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;quote&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=*_%28pokemon%29+&amp;amp;z=5&#39;&gt;https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=*_%28pokemon%29+&amp;amp;z=5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you plan on sharing multiple images together, we&amp;#039;d recommend posting just one, and give links for the rest. This way we can conserve space.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a locally run html tool provided by ThatOneAiAnon. It keeps track of all artists you like and turns Danbooru&amp;#039;s entire tag system in a collapsible list of buttons. You can edit all the js, css, html code to modify the tool. (Ask him for updated versions or more Nai4 tools)&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;quote&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;mega .nz/file/67xwTRSB#m0fPUmJRaWd3oh47gt6nw2LKNMe820TaiKdXTAhx8tI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Previous Thread: &lt;a href=&#34;/vp/thread/57653617#p57653617&#34; class=&#34;quotelink&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;57653617&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1743471857232515.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/vp/1743623501117871.jpg&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1743623501117871.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/vp/1743623501117871s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>

    <summary type="html">Mary Jane Watson becomes the new host of Venom in Marvel Comics&amp;#039; latest twist.&lt;br&gt; David Baldeón&amp;#039;s cover art mimics MJ and Peter Parker&amp;#039;s classic wedding scene.&lt;br&gt; Al Ewing teases soap opera thrills in MJ and Venom&amp;#039;s unlikely bond.&lt;br&gt; Upcoming drama: Flash Thompson faces a moral dilemma against MJ-Venom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bleeding Cool broke the news about the love that dare not speak its name over the weekend, that Mary Jane Watson was to be the new host of Venom. Now it&amp;#039;s all official, and in the comic book and everything, Marvel has revealed the new David Baldeon cover for All-New Venom #7 out in June that celebrates the new union.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The highly-anticipated ALL-NEW VENOM #5 hit stands yesterday, revealing that the new host of Venom is Mary Jane Watson! With the mystery behind Al Ewing and Carlos Gómez&amp;#039;s hot new run finally brought to light, the spoiler variant cover for ALL-NEW VENOM #7, on sale this June, can be unveiled!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Drawn by acclaimed artist David Baldeón, the cover pays homage to Peter Parker and Mary Jane&amp;#039;s iconic wedding in a twisted recreation of John Romita&amp;#039;s classic Amazing Spider-Man Annual #21 cover. Surrounded by Dylan Brock, Paul Rabin, and former All-New Venom suspects, MJ and and Venom celebrate their new commitment to each other as symbiote and host—till death do they part! Baldeón&amp;#039;s cover will also be available as a virgin variant cover.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;From strutting down runways as a high fashion model to fighting supervillains as the super hero Jackpot, Mary Jane&amp;#039;s life has taken some unpredictable turns—but never like this! Now that she&amp;#039;s been unmasked, the REAL mystery begins—how and why did she become ALL-NEW VENOM?! Stay tuned for answers in upcoming issues of ALL-NEW VENOM #6 as MJ&amp;#039;s adventures as a symbiote hero kick into high gear!&lt;img alt=&#39;1743700290619188.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/co/1743706953451918.jpg&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1743706953451918.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/co/1743706953451918s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>
