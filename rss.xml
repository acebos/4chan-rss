While the NSC official used his Gmail account, his interagency colleagues used government-issued accounts, headers from the email correspondence show.&lt;img alt=&#39;1540414291745.png&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1743592245138632.png&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1743592245138632.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1743592245138632s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>

During that time, the American Friends Service Committee, with the help of volunteers, helped with emergency supplies, clothes, food and basic necessities during the time the asylum seekers were waiting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of their tents remains, but they haven’t seen a migrant since mid-February.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We haven’t seen people in a while,” Adriana Jasso, the committee’s program coordinator said&lt;img alt=&#39;1741771437862429 (1).webm&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1743600566170191.webm&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1743600566170191.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1743600566170191s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>

    <title>[ 33] Loser Musk loses again, costs GOP Wisconsin Supreme Court</title>

    <summary type="html">&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/wisconsin-supreme-court-election-results-rcna198353&#39;&gt;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/wisconsin-supreme-court-election-results-rcna198353&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Susan Crawford has won a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, NBC News projects, allowing liberals to maintain their narrow majority on the battleground state’s highest court — and defying Elon Musk after he spent millions of dollars to oppose her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crawford, a Dane County circuit judge who was backed by Democrats, secured a 10-year term on the court over Brad Schimel, a Waukesha County circuit judge and a former Republican attorney general. As the first major battleground state election of President Donald Trump’s second term, the technically nonpartisan contest drew national attention and became the most expensive state Supreme Court race in U.S. history. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The outcome is a setback for Trump and his billionaire adviser, Musk. Trump endorsed Schimel in the final stretch of the race, while Musk injected himself into the center of it, spending huge sums of money, visiting Wisconsin days out from Election Day and frequently posting about the race on his X feed. In turn, Democrats and progressive groups made Musk their primary villain, attacking his influence on the race and his efforts to slash federal jobs and the government through the Department of Government Efficiency. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;As a little girl growing up in Chippewa Falls, I never could have imagined that I’d be taking on the richest man in the world for justice in Wisconsin,&amp;quot; Crawford told supporters Tuesday night. &amp;quot;And we won.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a brief concession speech, Schimel said, &amp;quot;I knew I had to put my all in,&amp;quot; but that &amp;quot;you gotta accept the results.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crawford’s victory also means liberals will maintain a 4-3 advantage on the court for at least another year heading into a term when it could decide cases about abortion rights, unions and collective bargaining rights, and congressional maps and redistricting.&lt;img alt=&#39;1741535582203.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1743568273912478.jpg&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1743568273912478.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1743568273912478s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>

I will say this a lot of the people working with DOGE are the secretaries, the heads of the various agencies, and they&amp;#039;ve learned a lot. And they&amp;#039;re dealing with the DOGE people.

    <summary type="html">Red mist edition&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NRL&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;quote&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;GAME 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Penrith Panthers v North Queensland Cowboys&lt;br&gt;6:00pm AEDST on Fox and Kayo&lt;br&gt;Commbank Stadium, Sydney&lt;br&gt;1.23-4.75&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;quote&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;Isaah Yeo will become the first Panthers player to reach 250 games, while the Cowboys strive for back-to-back wins. The Panthers need a response after a worrying 28-18 deficit against the Rabbitohs last week and their three-game slide is their worst since 2019. Their defence has been unsteady, and they will be desperate to rediscover their trademark control. The Cowboys, meanwhile, secured their first win of the season with a solid 30-20 victory over Canberra and will aim to build momentum. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Panthers 1-12 3.20&lt;br&gt;Panthers 13+ 1.82&lt;br&gt;Cowboys 1-12 5.20&lt;br&gt;Cowboys 13+ 12.00&lt;br&gt;Panthers -22.5 1.90 Cowboys +12.5 1.90&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;quote&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;GAME 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;South Sydney Rabbitohs v Sydney Roosters&lt;br&gt;8:00pm AEDST on Fox, Kayo and Ch9&lt;br&gt;Accor Stadium, Sydney&lt;br&gt;1.67-2.21&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;quote&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;Latrell Mitchell&amp;#039;s 2025 debut is well-timed as Book of Feuds rivals face off in a Friday night blockbuster. The Rabbitohs, under Wayne Bennett, have impressed early with three wins from four, including a statement 28-18 victory over Penrith last week. Their dominant first half against Penrith, where they led 28-0, showcased their attacking potential. Meanwhile, the Roosters suffered a frustrating collapse against the Titans, conceding 18 unanswered points in the final 20 minutes to end their 11-match winning streak against Gold Coast. Latrell Mitchell’s return for the Bunnies is a major talking point, but he will line up in the centres for the first time in Souths colours, with Jye Gray retaining the fullback spot. Isaiah Tass shifts to the wing to cover for the injured Alex Johnston. The Roosters welcome back Connor Watson at hooker, while Nat Butcher starts at lock in place of the injured Victor Radley. Lindsay Collins will move into the starting prop rotation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rabbitohs 1-12 3.00&lt;br&gt;Rabbitohs 13+ 3.20&lt;br&gt;Roosters 1-12 3.30&lt;br&gt;Roosters 13+ 5.10&lt;br&gt;Rabbitohs -2.5 1.94 Roosters +2.5 1.86&lt;img alt=&#39;Red mist.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/sp/1743709601930133.jpg&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1743709601930133.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/sp/1743709601930133s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>
