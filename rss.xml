Give us the consequences there. And what are you learning once they’re arrested? Why are they doing this?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BONDI: Well, we’re looking at so much on this. There have been three federal charges so far. And I say so far. We are looking at all of these cases across the country. We have a dedicated task force.&lt;br&gt;These are not isolated incidents, as you know, and these aren’t vandals. These are Molotov cocktails. That could be a weapon of mass destruction…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BARTIROMO: Wow.&lt;img alt=&#39;1733571901449496.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1742952920782148.jpg&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1742952920782148.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1742952920782148s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>

    <title>[ 69] Trump declassifies the FBI investigation of himself in 2016</title>

    <summary type="html">Trump has signed an order to declassify the FBI investigation into the Russian Collision Hoax of 2016&lt;br&gt;tl:Dr -- Mueller did not establish that Trump or members of his campaign coordinated or conspired with Moscow to affect the 2016 presidential electio&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5213403-trump-declassify-fbi-russia-investigation/&#39;&gt;https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5213403-trump-declassify-fbi-russia-investigation/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trump orders declassification of FBI’s Russia investigation&lt;br&gt;President Trump on Tuesday signed a memorandum directing the declassification of FBI files related to the investigation into his 2016 campaign’s potential ties to Russia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The memorandum calls for the declassification of “all files related to Crossfire Hurricane investigation,” White House staff secretary Will Scharf said as Trump prepared to sign the order at the White House.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We believe that it’s long past time for the American people to have a full and complete understanding of what exactly is in those files,” Scharf said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This was total weaponization. It’s a disgrace…but now you’ll be able to see for yourselves,” Trump said as he signed the memo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The FBI opened the Crossfire Hurricane investigation in July 2016 over whether members of Trump’s campaign were coordinating with Russian officials. The investigation preceded the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trump and his allies have for years cast doubt on the legitimacy of the FBI’s probe into his campaign, arguing it was a politically motivated investigation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mueller ultimately did not establish that Trump or members of his campaign coordinated or conspired with Moscow to affect the 2016 presidential election, but he and his team declined to reach a conclusion on whether the president obstructed justice.&lt;img alt=&#39;3pnbng.mp4&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1742946067928103.mp4&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1742946067928103.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1742946067928103s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>

    <title>[321] Hegseth Accidentally Adds Journalist To Secret Military Groupchat</title>
    <updated>2025-03-24T19:26:31Z</updated>

    <summary type="html">Jeffrey Goldberg, editor in chief of The Atlantic, was apparently included in a Trump administration group chat on Signal in which top officials debated and then discussed details of attacks against Houthi rebels in Yemen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The initial invite to the group apparently came from national security adviser Mike Waltz. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly sent the group details including weapons used, targets, and timing — two hours ahead of the attacks, which began March 15.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Others in the group were Vice President Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the stunning report, Goldberg claimed Waltz connected with him on Signal on March 11 and, two days later, he was invited to join a chain called the “Houthi PC small group,” in which they discussed strikes against the Houthi militant group in Yemen — seemingly unaware of the journalist’s presence in the group.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He wrote that he initially had strong doubts the text group was real, “because I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Goldberg also said he “could not believe that the national security adviser to the president would be so reckless as to include him in the discussions with senior U.S. officials.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He said he realized the text chain could be real after the person who was supposedly Hegseth messaged to the group that the first detonations in Yemen would be felt in two hours, at 1:45 p.m., which was in line with what took place. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;quote&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5211030-us-houthi-attacks-yemen/&#39;&gt;https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5211030-us-houthi-attacks-yemen/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;WrongNumber.png&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1742844391240502.png&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1742844391240502.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1742844391240502s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>

    <title>[ 33] Fentanyl deaths are plummeting because of biden</title>
    <updated>2025-03-24T20:48:28Z</updated>

    <summary type="html">Fentanyl deaths may be plummeting under trump, but he doesn&amp;#039;t have anything to do with it. NPR proves that it&amp;#039;s because of the most vulnerable users already being dead, and the ones that are left alive are using fentanyl more skillfully and carrying narcan around&lt;br&gt;Trump literally can&amp;#039;t do anything right&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.npr.org/2025/03/24/nx-s1-5328157/fentanyl-overdose-death-drugs&#39;&gt;https://www.npr.org/2025/03/24/nx-s1-5328157/fentanyl-overdose-death-drugs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reporter&amp;#039;s notebook: 8 theories why fentanyl deaths are plummeting&lt;br&gt;Over the past six months, I&amp;#039;ve been tracking something really cool and mysterious happening on American streets. For the first time in 30 years, drug deaths are plunging at a rate that addiction experts say is hopeful — but also baffling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the past, even the most ambitious, well-funded efforts to slow drug deaths only helped a little bit. Reducing fatal overdoses by 8% or 9% was seen as a huge win.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But now, deaths nationwide plunged more than 26% from the peak in June 2023, according to the latest preliminary data gathered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That means roughly 30,000 fewer people a year are dying. Many states are seeing even bigger improvements of 30% to 50%. In some states, progress has been sustained since 2021 and 2022, which suggests this isn&amp;#039;t a temporary blip&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So how did the U.S. finally turn the corner on drug deaths?&lt;br&gt;What&amp;#039;s going on? No one knows for sure, but here are eight leading theories I hear from experts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Naloxone, also known as Narcan, may be the game-changer. The Biden administration raced to make this medication, a nasal spray that quickly reverses opioid and fentanyl overdoses, far more widely available. People can buy it now over the counter without a prescription. It&amp;#039;s distributed for free in many high-risk communities, and people using drugs often carry it. It&amp;#039;s unclear how many lives naloxone is saving each year, but many front-line public health workers tell me the impact is huge.

    <title>[ 70] ‘Incendiary’ devices found at a Tesla showroom in Texas</title>

The APD bomb squad was called out to investigate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The devices were “determined to be incendiary” and were taken by police without incident, APD said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) also responded to the scene, an agency spokesperson told KXAN.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There have been numerous instances of vandalism aimed at Tesla showrooms and cars throughout the nation in the past few weeks, ranging from cars being defaced to cars or even Tesla chargers set on fire. In one instance, the Associated Press reported an Oregon man was arrested after he was accused of throwing Molotov cocktails at a store in Salem. It prompted the Justice Department last week to investigate, with Attorney General Pam Bondi saying “The swarm of violent attacks on Tesla property is nothing short of domestic terrorism.”&lt;img alt=&#39;teslad.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1742857481174598.jpg&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1742857481174598.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1742857481174598s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>

    <title>[ 65] Company Creates World’s First Self-Cooling Beverage Can</title>
    <updated>2025-03-26T00:48:35Z</updated>

    <link href="https://boards.4channel.org/ck/thread/21261694/" rel="alternate"></link>
    <summary type="html">A London-based startup has come up with an innovative self-cooling beverage can technology that could soon make drink refrigerators obsolete.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are few things better than a cold drink on a hot summer day, but with energy costs and refrigeration-related carbon emissions increasing every year, it’s high time humanity came up with a better, more eco-friendly way of chilling beverages. Enter Delta H Innovations, a London-based startup that claims to have developed the world’s first self-cooling aluminum can. Codenamed ‘Cool Can’, this intriguing invention combines clever design with simple chemistry to make magic happen at the press of a button. The company claims that the Cool Can can lower the temperature of its liquid contents to about 6-7 degrees Celsius (42.8 – 44.6 Fahrenheit) and keep them cool for up to 45 minutes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Cool Can looks like a normal aluminum beverage can, apart from the large “power” button on the bottom. The base of the can acts as a hidden water container, and when the button is pressed, the water is released into the space between the can’s double aluminum walls. Embedded between the walls are proprietary salts, which, in reaction with the water, start to rapidly cool the beverage inside.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to James Vyse, the Welsh founder of Delta H Innovations, it can take up to 10 minutes for the beverage to reach 6-7 degrees Celsius, depending on local temperature, but thanks to the can’s double-layer design, the contents remain cool for about 45 minutes. To let users know that their drink has cooled down enough, the Cool Can features a clever snowflake mark that turns from white to blue when the temperature of the can drops low enough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.odditycentral.com/news/finally-company-creates-worlds-first-self-cooling-beverage-can.html&#39;&gt;https://www.odditycentral.com/news/finally-company-creates-worlds-first-self-cooling-beverage-can.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;cool-can-1536x1536.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/ck/1742950115182285.jpg&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1742950115182285.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/ck/1742950115182285s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>

    <summary type="html">This is a general thread for people to post their AI art, and make requests from others who may want to attempt making their own Pokemon related gens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NovelAI is a paid AI generator. Opus tier users have &amp;quot;unlimited&amp;quot; Small/Normal generations, though editing tools require credits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Microsoft&amp;#039;s Bing AI is a free image generator that is powered by DALL·E 3.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Civitai is free using its ‘buzz’ currency. You get about 50 every day plus more for liking models and gens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;quote&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;civitai.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Otaiku is a (mostly) free mobile app. An ad watch is required between each image generation unless you pay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;quote&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;ailla.biz/otaiku&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tensor is free to use as well, although you are limited to how many gens you can make per day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;quote&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://tensor.art/&#39;&gt;https://tensor.art/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Local Generation using Stable Diffusion requires a decent video card. Guides for local genning can be found in the /g/ threads:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;//boards.4chan.org/g/catalog#s=sdg&#34; class=&#34;quotelink&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;/g/sdg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;//boards.4chan.org/g/catalog#s=ldg&#34; class=&#34;quotelink&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;/g/ldg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other Stable Diffusion threads are on: /h/, /e/, /d/, /b/, /vt/, /aco/, /trash/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hailuo AI takes uploaded art and animates them based on the prompts you get. You get a 3-day free trial, followed by roughly 3 free gens a day afterward. Subscription plans are available.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;quote&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://hailuoai.video/&#39;&gt;https://hailuoai.video/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pastebin of Pokemon artists:&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;quote&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://pastebin.com/U0mmK3Tm&#39;&gt;https://pastebin.com/U0mmK3Tm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Characters with under 300 images will require more tags to have them look correct. This is a list of all Pokemon characters with over 300 images:&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;quote&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=*_%28pokemon%29+&amp;amp;z=5&#39;&gt;https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=*_%28pokemon%29+&amp;amp;z=5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you plan on sharing multiple images together, we&amp;#039;d recommend posting just one, and give links for the rest. This way we can conserve space.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a locally run html tool provided by ThatOneAiAnon. It keeps track of all artists you like and turns Danbooru&amp;#039;s entire tag system in a collapsible list of buttons. You can edit all the js, css, html code to modify the tool.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;quote&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;mega .nz/file/67xwTRSB#m0fPUmJRaWd3oh47gt6nw2LKNMe820TaiKdXTAhx8tI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Previous Thread: &lt;a href=&#34;/vp/thread/57606559#p57606559&#34; class=&#34;quotelink&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;57606559&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;IMG_0119.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/vp/1742950352841042.jpg&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1742950352841042.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/vp/1742950352841042s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>

South Sydney’s early-season form has been promising, but their 27-12 loss to the Sharks exposed defensive lapses, particularly in the first half. They will need to tighten up against a Panthers side known for their ability to grind out results. Penrith’s slow start to the season is uncharacteristic for the reigning premiers, sitting at 1-2 after the six point loss to the Storm. Their attack struggled at times against Melbourne, but their defensive resilience kept them in the contest. They ultimately fell short, with injuries to Dylan Edwards and Nathan Cleary proving costly. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rabbitohs 1-12 4.90&lt;br&gt;Rabbitohs 13+ 10.00&lt;br&gt;Panthers 1-12 3.05&lt;br&gt;Panthers 13+ 1.95&lt;br&gt;Line Rabbitohs +11.5 1.93 Panthers -11.5 1.87&lt;img alt=&#39;AJ.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/sp/1743018986919279.jpg&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1743018986919279.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/sp/1743018986919279s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>
