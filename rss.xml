During that time, the American Friends Service Committee, with the help of volunteers, helped with emergency supplies, clothes, food and basic necessities during the time the asylum seekers were waiting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of their tents remains, but they haven’t seen a migrant since mid-February.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We haven’t seen people in a while,” Adriana Jasso, the committee’s program coordinator said&lt;img alt=&#39;1741771437862429 (1).webm&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1743600566170191.webm&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1743600566170191.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1743600566170191s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>

    <title>[ 33] Loser Musk loses again, costs GOP Wisconsin Supreme Court</title>
    <updated>2025-04-02T04:31:13Z</updated>

    <summary type="html">&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/wisconsin-supreme-court-election-results-rcna198353&#39;&gt;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/wisconsin-supreme-court-election-results-rcna198353&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Susan Crawford has won a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, NBC News projects, allowing liberals to maintain their narrow majority on the battleground state’s highest court — and defying Elon Musk after he spent millions of dollars to oppose her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crawford, a Dane County circuit judge who was backed by Democrats, secured a 10-year term on the court over Brad Schimel, a Waukesha County circuit judge and a former Republican attorney general. As the first major battleground state election of President Donald Trump’s second term, the technically nonpartisan contest drew national attention and became the most expensive state Supreme Court race in U.S. history. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The outcome is a setback for Trump and his billionaire adviser, Musk. Trump endorsed Schimel in the final stretch of the race, while Musk injected himself into the center of it, spending huge sums of money, visiting Wisconsin days out from Election Day and frequently posting about the race on his X feed. In turn, Democrats and progressive groups made Musk their primary villain, attacking his influence on the race and his efforts to slash federal jobs and the government through the Department of Government Efficiency. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;As a little girl growing up in Chippewa Falls, I never could have imagined that I’d be taking on the richest man in the world for justice in Wisconsin,&amp;quot; Crawford told supporters Tuesday night. &amp;quot;And we won.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a brief concession speech, Schimel said, &amp;quot;I knew I had to put my all in,&amp;quot; but that &amp;quot;you gotta accept the results.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crawford’s victory also means liberals will maintain a 4-3 advantage on the court for at least another year heading into a term when it could decide cases about abortion rights, unions and collective bargaining rights, and congressional maps and redistricting.&lt;img alt=&#39;1741535582203.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1743568273912478.jpg&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1743568273912478.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1743568273912478s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>

I will say this a lot of the people working with DOGE are the secretaries, the heads of the various agencies, and they&amp;#039;ve learned a lot. And they&amp;#039;re dealing with the DOGE people.

    <title>[ 59] Republicans censor PBS for Trump as Stalinist purge continues</title>

Marjorie Taylor Greene.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Coupled with President Donald Trump’s declaration on Tuesday that he would “love to” see federal funding cut off, the nation’s public broadcasting system is facing perhaps the biggest threat to its existence since it was first established in 1967. The broadcasters get roughly half a billion dollars in public money through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Republicans have frequently grumbled that PBS and NPR news programming leans left, but efforts to cut or eliminate funding usually fade because legislators want to protect their local stations — 336 of them for PBS alone, with those in rural areas most heavily dependent on taxpayer money.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The hearings on behalf of the new administration are one of multiple front on which Trump and his allies are aggressively challenging and in some cases sanctioning the American media, which the president has been sharply critical of for years. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This week alone, he denounced The Atlantic repeatedly for publishing texts from the Signal messaging app among high-ranking defense officials planning a military attack. Trump has also taken action against the Voice of America and other government-funded media and barred The Associated Press from the White House press pool and other events.&lt;img alt=&#39;1737530713043203.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1743462529935158.jpg&#39;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;1743462529935158.jpg&#39; src=&#39;http://i.4cdn.org/news/1743462529935158s.jpg&#39;/&gt;</summary>

And it&amp;#039;s not a tax - companies will absorb the price increases or reshore, or simply fail. People can skip buying a new phone every time one&amp;#039;s released and upgrade once every 2-3 generations.

    <summary type="html">I just noticed that for some reason there is no college football thread going. Feel free to discuss college football in this thread. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Me? I was just thinking about Alabamas defense this year and how scary they could be. It could easily be the case that bama is still bama and now that the Milroe era is over they are just going to kick ass again. I hope not though.
